# TransactX: Multi-Payment Gateway Integration Platform

TransactX is a full-stack platform designed to help businesses integrate multiple payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, and Square into one unified system. It offers flexibility in handling transactions, switching between gateways, and optimizing payment processes based on business needs. This solution allows for a seamless payment experience, reduces transaction failures, and provides advanced insights into payment metrics.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Payment Gateway Integration**: Integrate with Stripe, PayPal, Square, or any other gateway your business needs.
- **Dynamic Gateway Switching**: Automatically switch to a backup payment gateway if one fails
- **Transaction Overview**: A dashboard to monitor real-time transaction statuses, logs, and reports.
- **Error Handling and Notifications**: Handle failed payments gracefully with retry logic and send alerts to businesses in case of failures.
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Full encryption of sensitive data and PCI-DSS compliance.
- **Configurable Payment Methods**: Businesses can choose preferred gateways and configure payment rules per region or transaction size.
- **Analytics & Insights**: Track and analyze payment success rates, transaction trends, and gateway performance.
- **Fraud Detection**: Detect and prevent fraudulent activities with integrated fraud detection mechanisms.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: For the admin dashboard and business interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern UI design.
- **Secure Payment Form**: Built-in forms that are PCI-compliant.

### Backend:
- **Java (Spring Boot)**: For the main application logic and microservices architecture.
- **Microservices**: Each payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) is integrated as an independent service.
- **RESTful API Gateway**: Acts as the single point of entry for communication between the frontend and backend services.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: For managing user data, transaction records, and gateway configurations.
- **Redis**: For caching transaction statuses and optimizing performance.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure authentication and authorization of users and admins.

### Third-Party Integrations:
- **Stripe API**: Payment gateway integration for credit/debit cards and subscriptions.
- **PayPal API**: For international and digital wallet transactions.
- **Square API**: For POS and card-not-present transactions.
  
## How It Works

1. **Business Setup**: After registering, businesses can configure their payment gateways through the admin dashboard.
2. **Payment Processing**: Customers initiate payments via a secure payment form integrated with multiple gateways.
3. **Transaction Flow**:
   - Payment data is securely sent to the backend.
   - The platform chooses the appropriate payment gateway based on business configuration.
   - A response (success/failure) is recorded and relayed back to both the business and the customer.
4. **Dynamic Failover**: If a payment fails, the platform automatically retries with a backup payment gateway.
